# Gameplay:

"Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth" delivers a highly engaging gameplay experience. The storyline is rich with emotional depth and unexpected twists, keeping players hooked from start to finish.

The diverse range of side quests and mini-games adds layers of variety, ensuring there's always something new to explore.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility:

When it comes to playing "Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth" while running on a treadmill or riding an exercise bike, the experience is generally great. The game’s intricate combat system rarely has need for quick reflexes so it is not too challenging to manage during intense physical activity. The turn-based elements allow for any needed moments of respite, making it fairly feasible. Navigating the open world and engaging in less demanding side activities are very manageable, offering periods where you can maintain a steady pace without needing to pause.

In terms of computer requirements, "Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth" is fairly demanding. To enjoy the game in all its graphical glory, a beefy computer with a powerful GPU and a fast processor is recommended. High-quality graphics, detailed environments, and smooth performance can be achieved with a mid-to-high-end gaming rig. For those with lower-end systems, the game can still run, but expect to dial down the graphics settings to maintain a playable frame rate. Ensuring your setup meets the recommended specs will provide the best experience, especially important when you're combining gaming with physical activity on a treadmill or bike.
